If stack of function all send back boolean_t to indicate whether to continue
looping, how do functions communicate that a command has been found? Some function,
maybe handle command in my shell needs to have a if-else stack that functions can
fall through.

Builtins need seem to work, but redirect is a disater.
echo < cdpath
returned
Entered only executing Child Process.

Before creating new process, check if process should work in background.

Batch file execution of shell.

cd upwards wastes a run stripping off a trailing forward slash. Seems to add
on to head of path instead of last.
