If stack of function all send back boolean_t to indicate whether to continue
looping, how do functions communicate that a command has been found? Some function,
maybe handle command in my shell needs to have a if-else stack that functions can
fall through.

Left off at writing new_cmd_process in myshell. Need to implement, test, call in
handle_command.

Batch file execution of shell.
