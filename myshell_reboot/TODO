If stack of function all send back boolean_t to indicate whether to continue
looping, how do functions communicate that a command has been found? Some function,
maybe handle command in my shell needs to have a if-else stack that functions can
fall through.

Some of new_cmd_process in myshell is written. Begins with block for creating
detecting and handling pipe. The rest is a base case which can only be reached
with a pipe by calling recursively.
Wrote redirect in but not out. Wrote builtin function.
Calls a non-existent external function if builtin returns false.

Builtins need testing, but they're all coded all the way through.

Before creating new process, check if process should work in background.

Batch file execution of shell.
